## How to Play

### Step 1: Welcome Screen
- Read the introduction
- Click "Start Game" when ready
- **Tip**: Make sure you have 10-15 minutes without interruptions

### Step 2: Chapter 1 - Eusebius (5-7 minutes)

**What You'll Do:**
- Read about persecution in 303 CE
- Make **3 editorial choices** about how to write your account
- Time jumps to 313 CE (after Constantine wins)
- Make **2 more choices** about revising your account
- See your two versions side-by-side
- **Write a reflection** explaining why your text changed

**Important Tips:**
- **There are no right or wrong answers!**
- Think about WHY you're making each choice
- Consider: What do you include? What do you leave out? Why?

**Example Choices You'll Face:**
- How do you describe a bishop who hid from soldiers?
- Do you focus on violence or courage?
- Do you name priests who collaborated?
- How do you reframe the persecution after Constantine wins?

### Step 3: Chapter 2 - Augustine (4-6 minutes)

**What You'll Do:**
- Read about Augustine's garden conversion (386 CE)
- You're writing this 11 years later as a bishop
- Make **4 choices** about how to construct the narrative
- See your finished conversion story
- **Write a reflection** about how time and role shaped your writing

**Important Tips:**
- Think about what you emphasize vs. what you leave vague
- Consider your audience (who will read this?)
- Reflect on how being a bishop NOW affects how you tell a story from THEN

**Example Choices You'll Face:**
- Was the voice divine, mysterious, or natural?
- Do you emphasize emotions or spiritual struggle?
- How do you explain the "perfect" Bible passage?
- Do you focus on personal experience or community impact?

### Step 4: Final Reflection (2-3 minutes)

**What You'll Do:**
- Read a summary of what you learned
- **Write a final reflection** about your own storytelling
- Think about: When you tell stories from your past, what choices do YOU make?

### Step 5: Creative Writing (3-5 minutes) **NEW!**

**What You'll Do:**
- **Write your own short passage** (3-5 sentences) about:
  - An event from history, OR
  - An event from your own life
- Think about what you include, omit, and emphasize
- **Explain your choices**: What did you decide to highlight? What did you leave out?

**Why This Matters:**
By writing your own passage, you experience firsthand how authors shape narratives. This helps you better understand Eusebius and Augustine's choices!

**Example:**
> **Passage**: "When I moved to a new city, everything was difficult at first. But this challenge helped me grow stronger. Looking back now, I see it was the best decision I ever made."
>
> **Explanation**: "I chose to emphasize personal growth and positive outcomes. I left out details about loneliness and homesickness because I wanted to frame the story as triumph over adversity."

### Step 6: Download Your Work

**What You'll Do:**
- Click **"Download My Work"** to save everything as a text file
- This includes:
  - Your Eusebius texts (303 CE and 313 CE versions)
  - Your Augustine conversion narrative
  - All your reflections
  - Your creative writing passage and explanation

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this game, you should be able to:

✓ **Recognize** that all historical writing involves selection and framing

✓ **Explain** how an author's circumstances affect their narrative

✓ **Identify** editorial choices in primary sources (what's included, omitted, emphasized)

✓ **Analyze** how time and power change how events are remembered

✓ **Apply** these concepts to your own writing and storytelling

✓ **Critically evaluate** primary sources with more sophisticated tools

---

## Grading / Assessment (If Applicable)

**Check with your instructor**, but typically:

- **Completion**: Did you finish the game and all reflections?
- **Thoughtfulness**: Did you engage seriously with the reflection questions?
- **Creative Writing**: Did you write a passage and explain your choices?
- **Understanding**: Do your reflections show you grasped the concepts?

**This is NOT about:**
- Choosing the "correct" answers (there aren't any!)
- Writing long reflections (2-3 sentences is fine)
- Perfect grammar or spelling
- Agreeing with the instructor's interpretation

---

## Common Questions

### Q: How long will this take?
**A:** 10-15 minutes if you engage seriously. You can take longer if you want to write more detailed reflections.

### Q: Can I play more than once?
**A:** Yes! Try different choices to see how your narratives change. This can deepen your understanding.

### Q: Do I have to write reflections?
**A:** They're optional, but **strongly encouraged**. The reflections are where the learning happens!

### Q: What if I make a "wrong" choice?
**A:** There are no wrong choices! Every choice teaches you something about authorial perspective.

### Q: Can I change my answers?
**A:** No, the game moves forward only. This simulates real historical writing - once published, you can't take it back (only revise later!).

### Q: Will my instructor see my work?
**A:** Only if you submit the downloaded file. Your data stays in your browser unless you share it.

### Q: Do I need to know about Eusebius and Augustine beforehand?
**A:** No! The game provides all necessary context. However, if you attended the lectures, you'll recognize the material.

### Q: Can I use my phone?
**A:** Yes, the game works on mobile devices. However, typing reflections is easier on a computer.

### Q: What if the download doesn't work?
**A:** You can copy-paste your reflections directly from the text boxes before finishing.

## Example Student Work

### Good Eusebius Reflection:
> "My text changed because in 303 I was scared and wanted people to know how bad the persecution was. In 313, Constantine was emperor and I was a bishop, so I wanted to show that God had a plan all along. I softened my criticism of bishops who hid because now they're my colleagues."

### Good Augustine Reflection:
> "Writing 11 years later as a bishop, I emphasized God's grace and providence more than I might have in 386. As a bishop teaching others, I wanted to show that conversion requires divine help, not just human will. I made the voice and the Bible passage seem more clearly supernatural."

### Good Creative Writing Example:
> **Passage**: "During my first year at university, I struggled with every class. My grades were not good. But I learned to ask for help from professors and study with friends. By the end of the year, I felt more confident."
>
> **Explanation**: "I emphasized my growth and learning. I left out specific grades because I wanted to focus on the positive transformation. I framed struggle as temporary and necessary for growth, not as failure."
