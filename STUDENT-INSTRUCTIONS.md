## What is This Tool?

This is an educational tool about how ancient historians constructed their narratives. You will become Eusebius of Caesarea in 303 CE, writing an account of Christian persecution through a structured 4-stage process:

1. **Stage 1**: Make compositional choices about your approach
2. **Stage 2**: Select and arrange narrative components
3. **Stage 3**: Write your 100-200 word narrative
4. **Stage 4**: Review and export your work as JSON

## How to Complete the Tool

### Stage 1: Multiple Choice Decisions (5-7 min)

**What You'll Do**:
- Make 4 high-level choices about how to frame your narrative:
  1. What to emphasize (suffering, courage, cruelty, or divine purpose)
  2. Who the protagonist is (martyrs, community, leaders, or God)
  3. How much violence detail to include
  4. Where your narrative ends
- After 2 choices, see mid-feedback on your direction
- At the end, receive an "authorial profile" (e.g., "Theological Comforter")

**Tips**:
- There are **no right or wrong answers**
- Think about **why** you're making each choice
- Consider your audience (other Christians in 303 CE)

### Stage 2: Structure Your Composition (5-7 min)

**What You'll Do**:
- Select 6-8 narrative components from a pool of 16
  - The available components are based on your Stage 1 choices
  - Each component represents a specific storytelling element
- Drag and drop to arrange them in order
- Write 2-4 sentences explaining your structural reasoning

**Tips**:
- Your sequence matters - what comes first sets the tone
- Think about how each component leads to the next
- Explain WHY you chose this particular order

### Stage 3: Write Your Narrative (5-7 min)

**What You'll Do**:
- Write a 100-200 word narrative as Eusebius in 303 CE
- Follow the structure you created in Stage 2
- Use the sidebar reference to guide you
- Watch the word counter (green = good range)

**Tips**:
- Your work auto-saves as you type
- Minimum 100 words required to continue
- Write as if you're Eusebius documenting recent events
- Follow your Stage 2 sequence

### Stage 4: Export Your Work (2-3 min)

**What You'll Do**:
- Review all your work from all 4 stages
- Download your work as a JSON file
- Submit this file to your instructor (if required)

**JSON File Includes**:
- All your Stage 1 choices
- Your Stage 2 component sequence and rationalization
- Your Stage 3 narrative with word count
- Metadata (timestamp, version)

## Grading (Check with Instructor)

Typically assessed on:
- **Completion**: Did you finish all 4 stages?

- **Narrative Coherence**: Does your Stage 3 writing follow your Stage 2 structure?
- **Compositional Awareness**: Do you recognize the choices you made?

**Not assessed on**:
- Choosing "correct" answers (there aren't any!)
- Perfect grammar or spelling
- Agreeing with instructor's interpretation

## Common Questions

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 15-20 minutes if you engage seriously with each stage.

**Q: Can I change my answers?**
A: You can revise your narrative from Stage 4, but Stage 1-2 choices are final once you proceed (this mirrors real historical writing).

**Q: What if I close my browser mid-way?**
A: Your progress is saved! Reopen the same URL in the same browser and continue.

**Q: How do I submit my work?**
A: Download the JSON file in Stage 4 and submit it according to your instructor's directions.

**Q: Will my data be tracked?**
A: No. Everything stays in your browser. We don't collect any data.

## Tips for Success

1. **Read carefully**: The context boxes explain why each decision matters
2. **Think before choosing**: Each choice shapes your narrative
3. **Explain your structure**: Stage 2 rationalization is where deep learning happens
4. **Follow your structure**: Let Stage 2 guide your Stage 3 writing
5. **Review your work**: Stage 4 shows how all your choices connect
