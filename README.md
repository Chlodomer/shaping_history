**🐛 Report issues**: https://github.com/Chlodomer/shaping_history/issues

## Overview

Students become two ancient authors—Eusebius of Caesarea and Augustine of Hippo—making editorial decisions about how to present historical events. Through the game, students learn that all historical writing involves selection, emphasis, and framing based on the author's circumstances and goals.

## Educational Context

This game supplements lectures on:
- **Lecture 2**: Eusebius and persecution narratives
- **Lecture 3**: Augustine's *Confessions* and the garden conversion

**Learning outcomes**:
- Recognize how authorial perspective shapes historical narratives
- Understand that revision is a historical process
- Develop source criticism skills
- Distinguish between "lying" and "selective truth-telling"
