## Writing Guidelines

### Language Principles
1. **Simple English**: Maximum 15-20 words per sentence
2. **Active voice**: "You write" not "It is written by you"
3. **Present tense**: Makes it immediate and engaging
4. **Direct address**: "You are..." not "One is..."
5. **Concrete nouns**: Avoid abstractions when possible

### Vocabulary Guidelines
- **Use**: write, choose, hide, destroy, courage, fear, change
- **Avoid**: historiographical, epistemological, eschew, utilize
- **Define when necessary**: Provide tooltip for terms like "bishop," "persecution," "divine providence"

### Tone
- **Respectful**: These are sacred texts for many
- **Clear**: Never sacrifice clarity for style
- **Neutral**: Don't impose judgment on choices
- **Engaging**: Make students care about the decisions

303 CE - Your First Choice

CONTEXT BOX (blue background):
A bishop in your city hid from soldiers.
He did not want to be captured and killed.

QUESTION:
How do you describe what the bishop did?

CHOICES:
○ He hid shamefully
  (This makes the bishop look bad. It says he was a coward.)

○ He hid to survive
  (This is neutral. It explains his reason without judging.)

○ [Don't mention it]
  (This leaves it out of your account completely.)

You must choose what to emphasize.

QUESTION:
What part of the persecution do you want readers to remember most?

CHOICES:
○ The violence and destruction
  (Focus on suffering. Describe broken churches and burned books.)

○ The courage of martyrs
  (Focus on heroes. Describe Christians who stayed brave.)

○ Both equally

303 CE - Your Third Choice

CONTEXT BOX:
Some priests gave holy books to Roman soldiers.
They did this to save their own lives.
This was seen as betrayal by many Christians.

QUESTION:
What do you write about the priests who gave books to Romans?

CHOICES:
○ Give specific details about who did this
  (Name the priests. Tell exactly what they did.
   This shames them but creates a complete record.)

○ Mention it briefly without details
  (Say that some did this, but don't name them.
   This acknowledges the truth but protects people.)

○ Don't include this information
  (Leave it out completely. Only write about positive actions.)

CONTEXT BOX:
Constantine has won. Christians are now safe and respected.
The persecution is in the past.

QUESTION:
Looking back, what did the persecution mean?

CHOICES:
○ It was evil that tried to destroy Christianity
  (Keep your original view. It was a terrible tragedy.)

○ It was a test from God that made Christianity stronger
  (Reframe it as meaningful. God was testing and purifying the church.)

○ It was preparation for Constantine's victory
  (Reframe it as part of God's plan. The suffering led to this good outcome.)

CONTEXT BOX:
Remember the bishop who hid during the persecution?
He is still alive. He is now your colleague.
You work with him.

QUESTION:
You described him before. What do you do now?

CHOICES:
○ Keep your description unchanged
  (If you said "shamefully," keep saying "shamefully."
   If you omitted it, keep omitting it.
   Don't change based on your new situation.)

○ Soften the language to be more understanding
  (If you criticized him, make it gentler now.
   "He was afraid" instead of "he hid shamefully.")

○ Remove this section entirely
  (Take it out. It's embarrassing for him and for you.)

Chapter 2: Augustine's Garden

You are Augustine of Hippo.
The year is 397 CE.

You are writing a book called "Confessions."
You are describing your conversion to Christianity.

The conversion happened in 386 CE in a garden in Milan.
That was eleven years ago.

You are now a bishop.
You want to teach others about how God's grace works.

What You Remember

You remember your conversion in the garden:

• You were crying under a fig tree
• You heard a voice - maybe a child singing
• The voice said "Take and read" (tolle lege)
• You picked up Paul's letters and read a passage
• You felt sudden certainty and peace
• Your friend Alypius was there
• You told your mother Monica

Now you must write this story.
It happened eleven years ago.
How you tell it shapes what it means.

Writing Your Story - Choice 1

CONTEXT BOX:
You heard someone say "Take and read" (tolle lege).
You don't know exactly where the voice came from.
It might have been a child playing nearby.

QUESTION:
How do you describe this voice in your book?

CHOICES:
○ I heard God speaking through a child
  (Make it clearly supernatural. God sent a message.)

○ I heard a voice - I don't know where it came from
  (Keep it mysterious. Let readers wonder.)

○ I heard a child playing nearby
  (Make it natural. It was just a child, not a miracle.)

Writing Your Story - Choice 2

CONTEXT BOX:
You were crying in the garden.
You were very upset about your life.

QUESTION:
What do you emphasize about those tears?

CHOICES:
○ My emotional pain and suffering
  (Focus on your feelings. You were sad and confused.
   This is about human psychology.)

○ My spiritual struggle with God's call
  (Focus on your relationship with God. You wanted to obey but couldn't.
   This is about theology.)

○ Both emotions and spiritual meaning
  (Show both your human feelings and the religious meaning together.)

CONTENT:
Writing Your Story - Choice 3

CONTEXT BOX:
After hearing the voice, you opened Paul's letters at random.
Your eyes landed on Romans 13:13-14.
The passage was PERFECT for your situation.
It spoke directly about the exact struggle you were facing.

QUESTION:
How do you present this coincidence?

CHOICES:
○ God guided me to exactly the right passage
  (Make it clear this was God's plan, not chance.)

○ The passage seemed almost too perfect to be chance
  (Acknowledge how unlikely this was. Let readers decide.)

○ I read a passage from Romans 13
  (Just state the fact. Don't comment on the coincidence.)

After you converted, you told him what happened.
He read the next verse and converted too.
Your mother Monica had been praying for you for years.

QUESTION:
Do you focus on your private experience or show the community impact?

CHOICES:
○ Focus on my private, personal experience alone
  (Make this about your individual relationship with God.
   Keep it interior and psychological.)

○ Show how my conversion affected Alypius and my mother
  (Make this about community. Show how one conversion spreads to others.)

○ Both my experience and how it spread to others
  (Balance private experience with social impact.)

## Conclusion

### Screen 3.1: Final Summary
```
Type: Conclusion screen
Duration: ~60 seconds

CONTENT:
What You Learned

Both Eusebius and Augustine were shaping their stories.

They shaped them based on:
• Their situation
  (persecuted witness vs. powerful bishop)
• Their goals
  (survival, teaching, justifying power)
• Their audience
  (who will read this?)
• Time passing
  (events look different years later)

This doesn't mean they lied.
They chose what to emphasize, what to omit, and how to frame events.

All historians do this.
All writers do this.
Even you did this just now.

Final Question

Think about your own life.

When you tell a story from your past,
what choices do you make?

• What do you emphasize?
• What do you leave out?
• Why?

[Optional text box for response]

This is what ancient authors did too.
Understanding their choices helps us read their texts more carefully.
