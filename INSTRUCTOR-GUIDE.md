## Shaping History: Ancient Authors and Their Agendas

**Last Updated**: November 11, 2025

---

## Overview

This game teaches historiographical concepts through experiential learning. Students make editorial decisions as ancient authors (Eusebius and Augustine), then write their own narrative passage to apply these concepts.

### Key Innovation: Creative Writing Component
Students now write their own short passages and explain their editorial choices. This helps them:
- **Experience** authorial decision-making firsthand
- **Apply** concepts from the game to their own writing
- **Recognize** how all narratives (including their own) involve selection and framing

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this game, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** how authorial circumstances shape historical narratives
2. **Analyze** editorial choices in primary sources (what's included, omitted, emphasized)
3. **Explain** how time, power, and audience affect historical writing
4. **Apply** source criticism skills to their own storytelling
5. **Evaluate** primary sources with increased sophistication

---

## Game Structure

### Total Time: 12-18 minutes

**Chapter 1: Eusebius (5-7 min)**
- Context: Persecution narratives (303 CE → 313 CE)
- 5 decision points (3 in 303 CE, 2 in 313 CE)
- Side-by-side comparison of student's two versions
- Reflection on why text changed

**Chapter 2: Augustine (4-6 min)**
- Context: Garden conversion (written 397 CE about 386 CE)
- 4 decision points about constructing the narrative
- Display of student's constructed text
- Reflection on time/role effects

**Conclusion & Creative Writing (3-5 min)**
- Summary of key concepts
- Final reflection on personal storytelling
- **NEW**: Creative writing exercise
  - Students write 3-5 sentence passage
  - Students explain their editorial choices
- Download all work as text file

---

## The Creative Writing Feature

### What Students Do

Students write a short passage (3-5 sentences) about:
- A historical event, OR
- A personal experience

Then they explain:
- What did they choose to emphasize?
- What did they leave out?
- Why did they make these choices?

### Why This Matters

**Experiential Learning**: By becoming authors themselves, students internalize that:
- All narratives involve selection
- Framing creates meaning
- Omission is a powerful tool
- Context shapes how we tell stories

**Metacognition**: Explaining their choices makes their thinking visible and helps them recognize patterns in their own narrative construction.

**Transfer**: Students can now apply these insights to reading Eusebius, Augustine, and other primary sources.

### Example Student Output

**Strong Example:**
> **Passage**: "When I served in the military, we faced a dangerous mission. I was scared, but I trusted my commander's experience. We completed the mission successfully and everyone came home safe."
>
> **Explanation**: "I emphasized trust and successful outcome. I left out details about the actual danger and my fear because I wanted to show the mission as positive. If I wrote this for my family, I would emphasize safety even more. If I wrote it for fellow soldiers, I might focus more on the tactical challenges."

**Weak Example:**
> **Passage**: "I went to school and studied hard."
>
> **Explanation**: "I chose to write about school."

*(The weak example lacks detail, framing, and reflection on editorial choices)*

## How to Use This Game

### Option 1: Pre-Lecture (Inductive Approach)
- Students play BEFORE lectures on Eusebius/Augustine
- They discover concepts experientially
- Lectures reinforce and deepen understanding
- **Advantage**: Students come to class with questions

### Option 2: Post-Lecture (Deductive Approach)
- Teach Eusebius and Augustine lectures first
- Students play game to apply concepts
- Game reinforces lecture material
- **Advantage**: Students have context for their choices

### Option 3: Homework Assignment
- Assign as homework between lectures
- Require submission of downloaded work
- Use student reflections in next class discussion
- **Advantage**: Saves class time

### Option 4: In-Class Activity
- Play together as a class (project on screen)
- Discuss choices as a group before selecting
- Compare different narrative strategies
- **Advantage**: Rich discussion and immediate feedback

## Evaluating Student Work

### What to Look For

**In Eusebius Reflection:**
- Do they recognize how changing power dynamics (persecuted → bishop) affected choices?
- Do they understand the concept of selective truth?
- Do they grasp that both versions can be "true" but serve different purposes?

**In Augustine Reflection:**
- Do they understand how time changes memory?
- Do they recognize the role of theological agenda (teaching about grace)?
- Do they see how being a bishop NOW affects writing about THEN?

**In Creative Writing:**
- Is there a clear narrative with choices visible?
- Can they articulate WHY they made those choices?
- Do they recognize how context/audience would change the story?
- Do they connect to Eusebius/Augustine examples?

### Red Flags
- **"I just clicked randomly"** → didn't engage seriously
- **No explanation of choices** → didn't understand the exercise
- **"It's all lies"** → misunderstood the point (it's about selective truth, not fabrication)
- **Copy-paste from example** → didn't do their own thinking

### Excellent Indicators
- **Recognizes tension between truth and framing**
- **Understands that omission ≠ lying**
- **Connects personal experience to ancient authors**
- **Shows awareness of their own narrative construction**
- **Uses course terminology appropriately**

## Discussion Prompts for Class

### After Students Complete the Game

1. **Comparison**: "What choices did you make in 303 CE vs. 313 CE? Why?"

2. **Empathy**: "How did it feel to revise your account after your situation changed?"

3. **Application**: "How does this change how you read Eusebius's *Ecclesiastical History*?"

4. **Personal Connection**: "When you tell stories from your past, what do YOU emphasize or omit? Why?"

5. **Creative Writing**: "What did you learn about yourself as a narrator by writing your own passage?"

6. **Historiography**: "If all authors do this, can we ever know 'what really happened'?"

### Deeper Questions

7. **Ethics**: "Is it 'dishonest' for Eusebius to soften his criticism of bishops in 313? Why or why not?"

8. **Memory**: "Augustine wrote 11 years after his conversion. How might his memory have changed? Does that matter?"

9. **Power**: "How does being 'powerful' (bishop, winner's side) change what you can say about the past?"

10. **Modern Parallels**: "How do modern historians, journalists, or memoir writers do the same thing?"

## Pedagogical Notes

### Why This Design?

**No Right Answers**: Encourages authentic engagement rather than "gaming the system"

**Forward-Only Navigation**: Mirrors real historical writing (can revise later, but can't undo publication)

**Reflections Over Quizzes**: We want metacognition, not memorization

**Creative Writing**: Transforms passive learning into active practice

**Auto-Save**: Reduces technical frustration

**Download Feature**: Students own their work

### Alignment with Course Goals

This game supports:
- **Source criticism**: Students learn to "read against the grain"
- **Historiography**: Understanding how histories are constructed
- **Critical thinking**: Recognizing bias without dismissing sources
- **Empathy**: Understanding authors as humans with constraints and goals

### Common Misconceptions (to Address)

❌ **"Biased sources are useless"**
✓ Bias is inevitable; the key is recognizing and accounting for it

❌ **"Eusebius/Augustine were lying"**
✓ They were selectively framing truth, not fabricating

❌ **"We can never know what really happened"**
✓ We can reconstruct plausible accounts by reading multiple biased sources critically

❌ **"Modern historians are objective"**
✓ All writing involves selection and framing; awareness is key

## Appendix: Sample Student Work

### Example 1: Strong Work

**Eusebius Reflection**:
> "In 303 CE, I emphasized violence and named priests who collaborated because I wanted to create a complete record of suffering. In 313 CE, I reframed persecution as a test from God and removed names to protect my colleagues. My position changed from victim to authority, so my goals changed from documenting trauma to justifying divine providence."

**Augustine Reflection**:
> "Writing 11 years later as a bishop teaching about grace, I emphasized divine intervention more than I might have in 386. I made the voice and scripture passage seem clearly supernatural to support my theological point. If I wrote this immediately after, I might have focused more on my confusion and emotional state."

**Creative Writing**:
> **Passage**: "During my final exams, I studied every night for weeks. The pressure was intense, but I stayed focused. When I saw my grades, all the effort was worth it. This experience taught me that hard work pays off."
>
> **Explanation**: "I emphasized effort and positive outcome. I left out the anxiety, the times I wanted to give up, and the luck of certain questions appearing. I framed this as a success story about perseverance. If I told this story to someone who failed, I might emphasize luck more and effort less to be sensitive. If I told it to younger students, I'd emphasize hard work even more to motivate them. Just like Augustine teaching other bishops, my audience and purpose would change my emphasis."

### Example 2: Adequate Work

**Eusebius Reflection**:
> "My text changed because my situation changed. In 303 I was scared, in 313 I was safe."

**Augustine Reflection**:
> "Being a bishop made me think more about God's grace."

**Creative Writing**:
> **Passage**: "I went to a new school and made friends. It was good."
>
> **Explanation**: "I chose to focus on the positive parts."

*(Adequate but minimal - shows basic understanding but lacks depth)*
